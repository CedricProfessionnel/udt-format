# Training

Complex datasets may require in-depth instructions for annotators to correctly provide solutions. The top-level "training" key allows
a dataset creator to create a course, full specification and exams to prepare annotators to label a dataset.

> Note: The UDT provides a mechanism for creating "examples" via the root-level "example" key. This is an
> extension to "examples" that guides annotators through the learning process.
